# Final Project

## Brief idea presentation
##### Below you have linked a ppt with a brief summary of how the web is divided into microservices, what each of them contains and what I aspire to improve in terms of both backend and frontend in the future

## How it all began
##### As a fellow student in design engineering I developed a book trading system as part of one of my classes. This idea ignited the spark to deploy this whole web page since previewsly to the 9 weeks of bootcamp I was only able to develop the hardware part of the project.


## Utilities
##### The best way to summarize the different uses this web page was originally designed to have is using a Use Case Diagram.

##### The user and admin roles would be distinctible by using an authentification system

## How is the backend organized
##### The backend consists of two proxy services joined by an edge service. Each proxy service is connected to a different database.

## Technologies used in the process
